Develop a simple Credit Scoring Model using AI/ML techniques. Utilize a dataset
containing financial features such as income, credit history, loan amount, and
repayment behavior. Preprocess the data to handle missing values and normalize
features. Train a machine learning model, such as logistic regression or decision
tree, to predict creditworthiness. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics
like accuracy and ROC-AUC. This project demonstrates your ability to apply machine
learning algorithms to financial data for predicting credit scores, showcasing
practical AI/ML skills.
